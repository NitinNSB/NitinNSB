# 👋 Hey there! I'm Nitin Singh Bisht

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub!  
I'm a **student** on a mission to turn curiosity into code, and ideas into impact.

## 🚀 A Bit About Me

- 🧠 **Learning:** Always exploring new tech, especially in **AI** & **entrepreneurship**
- 🛠️ **Toolkit:** Python | SQL | PostgreSQL | Pandas | Numpy | Git
- 📜 **Certified in SQL** (thanks, DataCamp!)
- 🏊 When I'm not coding, you’ll find me swimming, drawing, or lost in a good book
